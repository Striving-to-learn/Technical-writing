Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Imagine the CPU as the brain of your computer. It's responsible for executing instructions from programs, making calculations, and handling data. In simple terms, it processes everything that happens on your computer. For gaming and demanding tasks, a more powerful CPU ensures smoother performance. Processor speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicates how fast your CPU can perform tasks.
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
The GPU, also known as a graphics card, is crucial for rendering images and videos. If you're into gaming or video editing, a powerful GPU can make a significant difference in graphics quality and overall performance. Some CPUs have integrated graphics, but dedicated GPUs are often better for gaming and intensive graphical tasks.Graphics card performance is often measured in terms of clock speed (in MHz or GHz), the number of cores, and memory capacity (measured in gigabytes, GB). 
Random Access Memory (RAM)
RAM is your computer's short-term memory. It stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can run simultaneously without slowing down your computer. For a seamless multitasking experience, consider upgrading your RAM.  RAM speed, measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz), determines how quickly data can be read from or written to RAM. 



Motherboard
Think of the motherboard as the central hub that connects all your computer parts. It is like a coach bringing all the parts of the team together.  It houses the CPU, RAM slots, GPU slot, and various connectors for peripherals like USB devices and storage drives. 
Storage Drives
There are two primary types of storage drives: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). HDDs are slower but offer more storage space for your files, while SSDs are lightning-fast but come at a premium price. Combining both types can give you a balance of speed and capacity.
Power Supply Unit (PSU)
The PSU supplies electrical power to all your computer components. It's essential to have a PSU that can provide enough wattage to support your CPU, GPU, and other components. A high-quality PSU also helps ensure your computer's stability and longevity. It's measured in watts (W), and the wattage should be sufficient to support your CPU, GPU, and other components. HDDs and SSDs are measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB).
Cooling System
As your computer operates, it generates heat, especially the CPU and GPU. Cooling systems, including fans and heatsinks, prevent overheating and maintain optimal performance. Some enthusiasts invest in liquid cooling solutions for improved temperature management.
Case
The computer case holds all your components and provides protection. Choosing the right case ensures that your components fit properly, and it also affects airflow, which can impact temperature management. Many cases come with RGB lighting for that extra style factor.
Monitors
Monitors are a crucial part of your computer setup, serving as both an input and output device. 
They are primarily considered output devices because they display the visual output generated by your computer's graphics card. Monitor specifications often include screen size, measured in inches, which determines the physical dimensions of the display, and resolution, typically measured in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080 or Full HD). A higher resolution means sharper and more detailed images. Refresh rate, measured in hertz (Hz), determines how many times per second the monitor refreshes the displayed image.
Input and Output Devices
Input and output devices are crucial for interacting with your computer. Input devices include your keyboard and mouse, which are often measured by features such as keystroke response time or DPI (dots per inch) sensitivity for mice. Output devices include your monitor and speakers, with monitor specifications including screen size (in inches), resolution (in pixels), and refresh rate (in hertz). Other input/output devices include webcams, microphones etc.
