There is a well-known documentary titled [*The Social Dilemma*](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224) on Netflix, which explores the profound impact of social media on society. 

For my in-person students, I developed a series of thought-provoking questions to spark discussion before watching the documentary, along with additional questions to consider during the viewing experience.
