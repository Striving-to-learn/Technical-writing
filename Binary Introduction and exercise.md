# Binary: The Language of Computers

Computers are incredibly powerful machines, but have you ever wondered how they process information? The secret lies in a special numbering system called **binary**, which is fundamental to how computers work.

## Decimal vs. Binary

- **Decimal** is the numbering system we use daily, with ten digits from 0 to 9.
- **Binary**, however, is a base-2 system, using only two digits: 0 and 1.

## Why Do Computers Utilize Binary?

- **Simplicity for Circuitry**: Computers use tiny electronic components like transistors to perform calculations and store information. These components can have two states: either on (1) or off (0). Binary is a perfect fit for this two-state nature.
- **Reliability**: Binary signals are less prone to errors and interference, ensuring data accuracy.
- **Efficiency**: Binary simplifies calculations, making them faster and more efficient.

If this seems confusing, don't worry! We will watch a video on the topic, and I will review some examples on the board. You can watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/ewokFOSxabs?t=109).

I would like you to do these examples by converting decimal numbers to binary and vice versa. On the second page, I have provided the above graph with some scratch paper to assist you
