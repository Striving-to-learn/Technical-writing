# ChatGPT, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence

## Key Definitions

- **Artificial Intelligence**: A broad field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning**: A way for computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- **Data**: Pieces of information that can be anything from numbers, words, images, or sounds.
- **Dataset**: A collection of data, organized for easier study or work. It could be a list of numbers, a table of measurements, or a set of images.

First and foremost, let's assume you have used ChatGPT or other AI tools. The question is, how does it work? Simply put, it works by reviewing data (information) and then learning from it.

ChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset comprising text from various sources, such as books, articles, websites, and other written material. This dataset serves as the foundation for the model's understanding of language and context.

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computer programs to learn from data and experiences without being explicitly programmed.

At its core, machine learning is the process of using algorithms to analyze data. It allows computers to “learn” from that data without being explicitly programmed or told what to do by a human operator. We will watch a brief video on machine learning: [Watch here](https://youtu.be/i4vKOCMgdgc).

9. **ChatGPT took information from thousands of copyrighted books and publications without compensating the creators at all. If you published a book and spent lots of time and money on it, do you believe that the creators of ChatGPT should compensate you? Why or why not?**
